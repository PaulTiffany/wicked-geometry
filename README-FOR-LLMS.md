# Wicked Geometry: Bounded-Observer Manifolds and Atlas Fracture

## Problem (bounded observers)
Institutional systems map rich inner realities with coarse outer metrics, creating misclassification and authority blind spots. Classical smoothness assumptions hide this bounded-observer gap.

## Solution (dual metrics + grace flow)
- Model worlds as dual-horizon manifolds: inner emergence metric `g_in`, outer projection metric `g_out`, resolution floor `ε_res`.
- Atlas fracture: curvature spike when the outer chart fails to map inner territory.
- Grace flow `φ(τ)`: Ricci-type repair that reconciles metrics without erasing identity.

## Empirical validation (V-Baum)
- Corpus: Baum 1900, Project Gutenberg epub/55.
- Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2; window 1000 chars, stride 200.
- Result: dominant semantic curvature peak at Chapter 19 (spectacles removed), prominence 0.1993; matches predicted `ε_res -> 0` event.
- Evidence: `atlas_fracture_evidence.png`, `vbaum_analysis_report.txt`, `oz_fracture.py`.

## Falsifiable predictions (P1–P6)
- P1: Dominant curvature peak aligns with unmasking/filter removal (validated in Baum).
- P2: Animal scenes persist but transport fails to outer decision nodes (connection annihilation).
- P3: Grace flow is gradual, not a single jump (monotone curvature decay).
- P4: Convergence depends on coupling strength (Lyapunov basin emergence).
- P5: Stackelberg misclassification raises concentration under captured regulation.
- P6: Apparent safety gains decouple from true risk reduction when capture is present.

## Applications
- AI alignment: spectral floors for resolution, grace scheduling for safety/capability blending, transport-failure monitoring for minority concepts.
- Regulatory capture: identify curvature spikes where policy optics diverge from underlying dynamics.
- Narrative topology: use curvature to locate fractures and repairs in story space.

**The Wicked Prior** establishes a geometric framework for analyzing how institutional authorities (Stackelberg leaders) misclassify corrective signals as adversarial noise.

This repository contains the formal proofs and the **V-Baum Validation Protocol** code corresponding to the paper: *The Wicked Prior as a Bounded-Observer Manifold*.

## 📄 Abstract
We formalize the *Wicked* narrative as an instantiation of bounded symbolic geometry. Oz is modeled as a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ equipped with an outer projection metric $g_{out}$ (social legibility) and an inner emergence metric $g_{in}$ (truth-seeking). We demonstrate that the "Defying Gravity" event represents an **Atlas Fracture**—a curvature blow-up where the outer chart fails to map the inner territory.

## 📉 Validation Protocol V-Baum
To empirically validate the geometric thesis, we apply `oz_fracture.py` to the original 1900 Baum text. 

**Hypothesis:** The unmasking of the Wizard (Chapter 15) constitutes a measurable discontinuity in semantic entropy.
**Result:** The model detects a sharp spike in embedding curvature ($||Ric||$) at the precise narrative moment the screen falls.
